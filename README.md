# z100emu

A Zenith Data Systems Z-100 emulator.

Partially implemented. z100emu can now boot to the ROM with no hardware faults!!! But no floppy/hard disk hardware is implemented, so you can't really do much yet. Stay tuned.

I forked the 8086 emulation code from the [Sharp8086](https://github.com/Programmdude/Sharp8086) project on GitHub.
