# z100emu

A Zenith Data Systems Z-100 emulator.

Partially implemented. z100emu can boot the system rom, but fails early because of missing hardware emulation. More to come at some point.

# Attribution Notes

I forked the 8086 emulation code from the [Sharp8086](https://github.com/Programmdude/Sharp8086) project on GitHub.
